## Description

Riwi Link-up-ms is a WebAPI developed in C# that provides a comprehensive backend solution for managing social connections and professional networking. It offers features such as user profile management, connection requests, messaging, and analytics for network growth.

# Technical Overview

## API Architecture
- Implemented using ASP.NET Core Web API
- Follows RESTful principles for endpoint design
- Utilizes Entity Framework Core for ORM capabilities

## Core Functionalities

### Developer Profile Management
- CRUD operations for developer profiles
- Endpoints: 
  - `GET /api/developers`
  - `POST /api/developers`
  - `PUT /api/developers/{id}`
  - `DELETE /api/developers/{id}`

### Client Access and Filtering
- Advanced filtering system for developer profiles
- Endpoints: 
  - `GET /api/developers/filter?language={lang}&englishLevel={level}&softSkills={skills}`

### Admin Management Interface
- Secure endpoints for administrative tasks
- Endpoints: 
  - `PUT /api/admin/developers/{id}`
  - `POST /api/admin/bulkUpdate`

## Data Models
- **Developer:** Encapsulates developer information including technical skills, language proficiency, and soft skills
- **Client:** Represents RIWI clients with specific project requirements
- **Project:** Defines project structures and developer assignments

## Authentication and Authorization
- Implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure API access
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for client and admin functionalities

## Database Design
- Utilizes SQL Server for relational data storage
- Includes tables for Developers, Clients, Projects, Skills, and relational mapping tables

## API Features
- Pagination support for large data sets
- Sorting and filtering capabilities on relevant endpoints
- Data validation and error handling middleware

## Integration Points
- Endpoints designed for seamless integration with the frontend application
- Supports both JSON and XML response formats for flexibility

## Performance Optimization
- Implements caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous programming model for improved scalability

## Monitoring and Logging
- Integrated logging system for tracking API usage and errors
- Endpoints for health checks and system status: `GET /api/health`

## Deployment and Scalability
- Containerized using Docker for easy deployment
- Designed for horizontal scalability in cloud environments

This backend API forms the foundation of Riwi LinKUp, enabling efficient matching of developers with client projects based on technical prowess, English proficiency, and soft skills. The system's architecture ensures that administrators can easily update and manage developer information, keeping the talent pool aligned with market demands and project objectives.
