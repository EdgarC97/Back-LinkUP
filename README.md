## Description

Riwi Link-up-ms is a WebAPI developed in C# that provides a comprehensive backend solution for managing social connections and professional networking. It offers features such as user profile management, connection requests, messaging, and analytics for network growth.

# Technical Overview

## API Architecture
- Implemented using ASP.NET Core Web API
- Follows RESTful principles for endpoint design
- Utilizes Entity Framework Core for ORM capabilities

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API forms the foundation of Riwi LinKUp, enabling efficient matching of coders with user projects based on technical prowess, English proficiency, and soft skills.

## Core Functionalities

### Account Management
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/account/register`
  - `POST /api/v1/account/login`

> [!NOTE]
> The Account Controller handles user registration and authentication.

### Coder Profile Management
- CRUD operations for coder profiles
- Endpoints: 
  - `GET /api/v1/coders`
  - `GET /api/v1/coders/{id}`
  - `GET /api/v2/coders`
  - `GET /api/v2/coders/{id}`
  - `POST /api/v2/coders`
  - `PUT /api/v2/coders/{id}`
  - `PATCH /api/v2/coders/{id}`
  - `DELETE /api/v2/coders/{id}`

> [!TIP]
> The v2 endpoints provide more detailed and flexible operations for coder profiles.

### User Access and Filtering
- Advanced filtering system for coder profiles
- Endpoints: 
  - `GET /api/v1/coders/filter?language={lang}&englishLevel={level}&softSkills={skills}`

### Admin Management Interface
- Secure endpoints for administrative tasks
- Endpoints: 
  - `PUT /api/admin/coders/{id}`
  - `POST /api/admin/bulkUpdate`

### Sector Management
- Endpoint:
  - `GET /api/v1/sector`

> [!NOTE]
> This endpoint retrieves all sectors available in the system.

### User Management
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/user`
  - `GET /api/v1/user/email/{email}`
  - `PATCH /api/v1/user/{email}`
  - `DELETE /api/v1/user/{email}`

> [!CAUTION]
> Be careful when using the DELETE endpoint as it permanently removes a user from the system.

### Dashboard
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/dashboard/coders-in-training`
  - `GET /api/dashboard/frontend-coders`
  - `GET /api/dashboard/backend-coders`
  - `GET /api/dashboard/companies-by-month`

> [!TIP]
> These endpoints provide valuable insights for administrative purposes.

## Data Models
- **Coder:** Encapsulates coder information including technical skills, language proficiency, and soft skills
- **User:** Represents Riwi LinKUp users with specific project requirements
- **Project:** Defines project structures and coder assignments

## Authentication and Authorization
- Implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure API access
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for user and admin functionalities

> [!WARNING]
> Always keep your JWT secret key secure and never expose it in client-side code.

## Database Design
- Utilizes SQL Server for relational data storage
- Includes tables for Coders, Users, Projects, Skills, and relational mapping tables

## API Features
- Pagination support for large data sets
- Sorting and filtering capabilities on relevant endpoints
- Data validation and error handling middleware

## Integration Points
- Endpoints designed for seamless integration with the frontend application
- Supports both JSON and XML response formats for flexibility

## Performance Optimization
- Implements caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous programming model for improved scalability

> [!TIP]
> Consider implementing caching for endpoints that return data that doesn't change frequently.

## Monitoring and Logging
- Integrated logging system for tracking API usage and errors
- Endpoints for health checks and system status: `GET /api/health`

## Deployment and Scalability
- Containerized using Docker for easy deployment
- Designed for horizontal scalability in cloud environments

> [!NOTE]
> The system's architecture ensures that administrators can easily update and manage coder information, keeping the talent pool aligned with market demands and project objectives.
